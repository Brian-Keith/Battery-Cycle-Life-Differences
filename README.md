# Battery-Cycle-Life-Differences
Public version of Brian Keith's Project for ISYE 6420 (Bayesian Statistics) at Georgia Tech.

This project was inspired by my interest in batteries as an ever-growing part of the technology we use every day. The goal of this project is to utilize Bayesian techniques to determine if there is a statistical difference in the cycle life between batteries charged under different fast charging methods.

Data from this project was sourced from Severson, Kristen A., et al. "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation." *Nature
Energy* Volume 4 (2019): 383â€“391.

I, Brian Keith, grant permission for this project to be used as an example for future ISYE 6420 students.

Please note that while the a summary version of the data used for the project, required to run `02 Analyze Battery Data.ipynb` was provided, the actual source data downloaded from [Severson, 2019](https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204) is handled in the `00 Build Pickle Files for Data.ipynb` and `01 Clean and Consolidate Battery Data.ipynb` but requires significant memory (~45-50 GB) to process.
