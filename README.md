# Battery-Cycle-Life-Differences
Public version of Brian Keith's Project for ISYE 6420 (Bayesian Statistics) at Georgia Tech.

This project was inspired by my interest in batteries as an ever-growing part of the technology we use every day. The goal of this project is to utilize Bayesian techniques to determine if there is a statistical difference in the cycle life between batteries charged under different fast charging methods.

Data from this project was sourced from Severson, Kristen A., et al. "Data-driven prediction of battery cycle life before capacity degradation." *Nature
Energy* Volume 4 (2019): 383â€“391.
